# Serialization 

Current it is very hard to customize how data is serialized, you either have to use the built in code generated by weaver or create a Write/Read function for the whole type.


One Improvement on this would be to add attributes that weaver could check for and allow better control over what is done.

One use of this would be to allow users to give an Explicit layout for structs then use WriteBlittable. All we would need is an attribute that tells weaver to set WriteBlittable<T> as the write function for the type.

This level of customization could be applied at a field level too. You might want some Vector3 to be compressed, and others not. Same applies to int values, some could be packed (like indexes) and others shouldn't (like hashses)
